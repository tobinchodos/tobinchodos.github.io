Welcome to the course page! Here you can find weekly reading assignments
and listening assignments for eight weeks' worth of study of American
Popular Music. I hope that during these eight weeks, we can not only
study the history of eight important American genres, but also introduce
you to the kind of thing that you'd be expected to do if you chose to
study music at the University level in the United States. And of course
I'm happy to answer any practical questions you might have about various
college programs here. I can also help you with your applications, if
you choose to go in that direction.

### Course Overview

#### [Week 1](#weekone) - The Blues {#-week-1-weekone-the-blues}

This week, we discuss perhaps the most influential American music of all
-- its development from African to the Mississippi Delta, through to its
influence on all American and global pop.

#### [Week 2](#weektwo) - Tin Pan Alley and Vaudeville {#-week-2-weektwo-tin-pan-alley-and-vaudeville}

This week, we'll talk about the rise of the American Popular Song, as it
was pioneered by the publishing industry in New York during the early
20th century.

#### [Week 3](#weekthree) - Jazz {#-week-3-weekthree-jazz}

This week, we'll look at a genre that often worked with the repertoire
of Tin Pan Alley, but by combining it with the music of African
Americans and others, did some very original and special things with it.

#### [Week 4](#weekfour) - Jazz continued {#-week-4-weekfour-jazz-continued}

///

#### [Week 5](#weekfive) - Rock {#-week-5-weekfive-rock}

This week, we'll look at a genre that takes the Blues form and, for the
first time, transforms it into a commercially viable, generally "white"
music. We'll study Rock's origins in Rhythm and Blues, its European
influences, and its contemporary global reach.

#### [Week 6](#weeksix) - Country and Bluegrass {#-week-6-weeksix-country-and-bluegrass}

#### [Week 7](#weekseven) - Hip Hop {#-week-7-weekseven-hip-hop}
